I am create a website to allow user to create tours to insert into database. The requirement is now very simple, make a creative way to help user insert tours, I prefer doing it steps by steps. For example first is ask for the tour name, at least 6 images about the tour, short description then step 2, 3, 4 you recoment. My database is supabase and it is alrady setup. This project is a template from supabase I want to mofidy it, if no session redirect user to login page, they must login. If yes they will enter home page and home page display a simple list of tour, with a button to create tours. Make the list simple, 1 table 5 rows, no pageing not filter no anything, just a table with button create tour. Create tour page should make it simple I will ask you to modify later. no need to actually insert into db for now I want ui only
